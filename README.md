# Smart-Parking-System
Efficient parking management is essential in urban areas and facilities where parking space is limited. The rapid increase in the number of vehicles has created a need for structured and automated parking systems that can help reduce parking congestion, improve space utilization, and facilitate a smoother parking experience for users. This project addresses these needs by developing a simple yet effective parking management system in C++ for a small-scale parking facility with limited parking spots.
